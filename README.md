🎥 Automated Video News Generation

This project explores the integration of large language models (LLMs), voice cloning with text-to-speech (TTS) technology, and process automation to generate fully automated news videos. The system enhances text generation, replicates natural-sounding voices in multiple languages, and synchronizes visuals and audio for scalable video production.​

📌 Features

Automated Text Generation: Utilizes LLMs to create coherent and contextually relevant news scripts.​
Voice Cloning with TTS: Implements advanced TTS technology for natural and expressive voice synthesis in multiple languages.​
Visual and Audio Synchronization: Ensures seamless alignment between generated audio and corresponding visuals.​
Process Automation: Streamlines the workflow from text creation to final video production.​
